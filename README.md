# dht â€” Distributed Hash Table for Erlang

The `dht` application implements a Distributed Hash Table for Erlang. It is hashed from the etorrent application in order to make it possible to use it without using the rest of etorrent.

The short overview is that this DHT has the following qualities:

* Stores a mapping from *identities* (256 bit keys) to pairs of `{IP, Port}` on which you can find the value with said identity. Thus, the hash table stores no data itself, but leaves data storage to an external entity entirely. You can use any storage system on the target IP/Port as you see fit.
* Uses the Kademlia protocol to implement a distributed hash table in order to spread out identities over multiple known nodes.
* Storage is *probalistic*. There is a small chance a given entry will go away if the "right" nodes dies. The system will however, if implemented correctly, reinstate the stored value in at most 1 hour if this happens. The more nodes you have, the less the risk of identity mapping loss.
* Lookup is logarithmic and gradually covers the 256 bit space. Thus, lookup is usually not extremely fast, but it is extremely durable. In order words, it is not a DHT for fast lookup.

The current state of the code is that it is not ready yet for many reasons. We are slowly moving in the right direction, rewriting pieces of the code base and redesigning more and more of the system so it is free of the etorrent clutches. But cleaning up an old code base will take some time to pull off and it is not a fast job that happens quickly.

While here, a lot of decisions has to be made in order to ensure future stability of the code base. So focus is on clear code and simple solutions to problems.

## Analysis

The code here is excised from ETorrent. We want to hammer on the code until it works and begins to provide a working system. To do this, we will start out simple and then gradually make the code base work as it should in a larger setting. The trick is to run the code through several milestones, each one layering on top of the milestone which came before. The code is currently in an unknown state, so the goal is to establish exactly what works, what doesn't and how things are working or not.

# TODO List:

haphazard things we should do.

* The `dht_iter_search` function in `dht_net` needs a lot of care and perusal. It is a very large imperative function, which should be rewritten into a more functional style and simplified while we are at it.
* Split all timer code to a helper library. This should help later on with writing QuickCheck models for different components of the system.
* make `dht_state` sequential by putting the UNREACHABLE_TAB into the gen_server itself. It should not be much slower having it in there.
* Figure out the API of the system. Currently it is in shambles and it needs some help.
