@title DHTâ€”A distributed hash table for Erlang
@doc This application implements a service for running as a peer in a DHT swarm.

All communication is loose and based on sending UDP messages around between
peers. There is no other connectivity needed between peers in the swarm.

The implementation is essentially the Kademlia variant used in BitTorrent. This DHT has
been known to scale to several million nodes on the internet with ease.

The DHT only provides an association between a unique `ID' and an `{IP, Port}' pair. From
here, you will need to specify your own protocol to run. It is advised to pick ID's which are
content addressed to provide integrity. For instance by execution of
`crypto:hash(sha256, Content)' to obtain an ID.
