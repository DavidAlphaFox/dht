# Making contributions to this project

Rule #1: Don't piss Jesper off.

We have fairly good EQC coverage, so if you write any PR, discuss how you want to test that your change is correct, and how it fits into the model at large. Most bugs will mean one of two things:

* The model is wrong.
* The model doesn't cover the area you have found a bug in.

Most features will require at least some model change.
